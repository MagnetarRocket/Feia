To run "Insert name here" just type sh ./feia-run.sh (replace feia-run.sh with whatever name you want, just keep the .sh)

"/archicture" is the archicture dependent verisons of the program in question, "/cross" is the cross-platform data of the program and is not angry,

Due to i not looking at it from the start, one may need to do `sudo chmod +x "appname"` to get the script working.
