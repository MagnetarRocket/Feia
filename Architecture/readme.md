This is the architectures folder, to add a suported Architecture to this list, just simply add the compiled architecture of the program to a 
directory to this list, eg:

* /x86-64/OpenBSD
* /Aarch64/Darwin
* /m68k/NetBSD
* /riscv/FreeBSD
* /powerpc/Linux
* /mips/Linux
* /sparc/SunOS

.. and the other things.
